# Techno Blogs

The main repo for my website is over at [nextjs-notion-starter-kit](https://github.com/visakh47/TechnoBlogs).

This repo only exists to store comments for my [personal blog](https://bit.ly/Technoblogs).

It uses [Utteranc.es](https://utteranc.es/), which is an amazing [open source project](https://github.com/utterance/utterances) that enables developers to embed GitHub issues as a comments section on their websites. Genius.
